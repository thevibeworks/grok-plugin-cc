# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-25

Fixed a start-up failure on Linux machines without a sandbox enforcer.

- `--sandbox` is no longer sent unconditionally. Grok's Linux enforcer is
  bubblewrap, which plain Debian/Ubuntu and WSL images do not ship, and grok
  1.0.3 **refuses to start** when it is missing rather than warning and
  continuing — so every sandboxed invocation failed with exit 1 and empty
  stdout. Reported with a live repro by @roy7 in #1.
- A read-leaning rescue now drops the flag and keeps its tool deny list, which
  is the guard that never needed the kernel. `--write` refuses instead, because
  there the workspace sandbox is the only thing bounding edits; the error names
  `apt install -y bubblewrap`.
- `GROK_COMPANION_SANDBOX=on|off` overrides the probe.
- `--sandbox` is no longer re-sent on `--resume`. A profile that differs from
  the session's saved one is a hard error, and omitting it is always accepted.
- Security Model in the README documented the opposite behaviour (silent
  degradation under Landlock), which was true of older Grok releases and is not
  true of 1.0.3.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-12

Initial release.

- `/grok:review` and `/grok:adversarial-review`: structured, read-only code
  reviews via Grok headless mode with `--json-schema` output and a
  `read_file,grep,list_dir` tool allowlist.
- `/grok:rescue` + `grok:grok-rescue` subagent: task delegation with
  read-leaning defaults, `--write` opt-in, `--resume`/`--fresh` session
  routing, and background execution.
- `/grok:transfer`: import the current Claude Code transcript into Grok via
  `grok import` and print the `grok --resume` handoff command.
- `/grok:status`, `/grok:result`, `/grok:cancel`: per-workspace job control.
- `/grok:setup`: prerequisite and auth checks.
- Session lifecycle hooks record the transcript path and clean up background
  jobs at session end.
